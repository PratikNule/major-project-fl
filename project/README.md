# Federated Learning Blockchain Fraud Detection

This project implements a federated learning system for detecting fraudulent blockchain transactions. It uses a non-IID data distribution across multiple clients to simulate real-world scenarios where financial institutions collaborate without sharing raw data.

## Features

- **Federated Learning**: Train fraud detection models across multiple clients without sharing raw data
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Monitor client status, model performance, and transaction predictions
- **Synthetic Transaction Generation**: Simulate realistic fraud patterns
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare federated vs. centralized model performance

## Setup
